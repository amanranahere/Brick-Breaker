# Brick Breaker

Brick Breaker is a classic arcade-style game where players control a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks. The goal is to clear all the bricks while keeping the ball in play. This game is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## üèóÔ∏è The Making Of
I built this project as a fun way to practice working with the **HTML5 Canvas element** in JavaScript. One of the key things I learned was handling **collision detection**, ensuring that the ball interacts correctly with bricks, the paddle, and the screen boundaries.  

Another interesting aspect was managing **game physics**, like the ball‚Äôs movement and how it bounces off different surfaces. I also implemented **progressive difficulty**, where more rows of bricks are added as the player advances.  

This project really helped me improve my understanding of **game loops**, **event handling**, and working with **2D graphics** in JavaScript. It was a great way to apply my knowledge while creating something interactive and enjoyable.
